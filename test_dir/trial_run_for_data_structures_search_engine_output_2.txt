Title: Pathology in Captive Wild Felids at German Zoological Gardens
Research Paper ID: 51c863bc37f993b3da543b91458e3ed5abd9aba9

This retrospective study provides an overview on spontaneous diseases occurring in 38 captive wild felids submitted for
necropsy by German zoological gardens between 2004 and 2013. Species included 18 tigers, 8 leopards, 7 lions, 3 cheetahs
 and 2 cougars with an age ranging from 0.5 to 22 years. Renal lesions, predominantly tubular alterations (intra-tubular
 concrements, tubular degeneration, necrosis, intra-tubular cellular debris, proteinaceous casts, dilated tubuli) follow
ed by interstitial (lympho-plasmacytic inflammation, fibrosis, metastatic-suppurative inflammation, eosinophilic inflamm
ation) and glomerular lesions (glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, amyloidosis) were detected in 33 out of 38 animal
s (87%). Tumors were found in 19 of 38 felids (50%) with 12 animals showing more than one neoplasm. The tumor prevalence
 increased with age. Neoplasms originated from endocrine (11), genital (8), lympho-hematopoietic (5) and alimentary orga
ns (4) as well as the mesothelium (3). Most common neoplasms comprised uterine/ovarian leiomyomas (5/2), thyroid adenoma
s/adenocarcinoma (5/1), pleural mesotheliomas (3), hemangiosarcomas (2) and glossal papillomas (2). Inflammatory changes
 were frequently encountered in the intestine and the lung. Two young animals displayed metastatic mineralization sugges
tive of a vitamin D-or calcium intoxication. One tiger exhibited degenerative white matter changes consistent with an en
tity termed large felid leukoencephalomyelopathy. Various hyperplastic, degenerative and inflammatory changes with minor
 clinical significance were found in several organs. Summarized, renal lesions followed by neoplastic changes as well as
 inflammatory changes in lung and gastrointestinal tract represent the most frequent findings in captive wild felids liv
ing in German zoological

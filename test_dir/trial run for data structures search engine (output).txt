Preview:
Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coro
navirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs. Despite this, only 6% of
 all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or ag
ricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rat
her than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor count
ries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host
taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences rep
resenting 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiolo
gic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the majo
r evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used
 to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variati
on exists in the dynamics of this process. Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and
 advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic

Although the majority of emerging infectious diseases can be linked to wildlife sources, most pathogen spillover events
to people could likely be avoided if transmission was better understood and practices adjusted to mitigate risk. Wildlif

rious threat to human health was then evaluated at seven markets identified as having high volumes of trade. At the seve

 sale, including mammals from 12 taxonomic families previously documented to be capable of hosting 36 zoonotic pathogens

Title: A Review of Zoonotic Infection Risks Associated with the Wild Meat Trade in Malaysia
Research Paper ID: 4925de9bb1feab39f0ffda885f95b59fd0e10cc7

Preview:
The overhunting of wildlife for food and commercial gain presents a major threat to biodiversity in tropical forests and
 poses health risks to humans from contact with wild animals. Using a recent survey of wildlife offered at wild meat mar
kets in Malaysia as a basis, we review the literature to determine the potential zoonotic infection risks from hunting,
butchering and consuming the species offered. We also determine which taxa potentially host the highest number of pathog
ens and discuss the significant disease risks from traded wildlife, considering how cultural practices influence zoonoti
c transmission. We identify 51 zoonotic pathogens (16 viruses, 19 bacteria and 16 parasites) potentially hosted by wildl
ife and describe the human health risks. TheSuidae and the Cervidae families potentially host the highest number of path
ogens. We conclude that there are substantial gaps in our knowledge of zoonotic pathogens and recommend performing micro
bial food safety risk assessments to assess the hazards of wild meat consumption. Overall, there may be considerable zoo
notic risks to people involved in the hunting, butchering or consumption of wild meat in Southeast Asia, and these shoul
d be considered in public health
